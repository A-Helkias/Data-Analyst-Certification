Parfait ! Comme ta prÃ©sentation PowerPoint est finalisÃ©e et bien structurÃ©e, je vais maintenant tâ€™aider Ã  rÃ©diger **le script complet** de ce que tu peux dire Ã  lâ€™oral, **slide par slide**, de faÃ§on fluide, claire et naturelle â€” comme si tu Ã©tais en train de prÃ©senter Ã  un collÃ¨gue ou Ã  une salle.

## ðŸŽ¤ **SCRIPT DE PRÃ‰SENTATION Ã€ Lâ€™ORAL**

---

### **Slide 1 â€” Context & Business Goals**

> "Hello, and thank you for taking the time to join this session.
> The goal of this analysis was to help determine which of the three sales methods â€” Email, Call, or Email + Call â€” performs best for the new product line.
>
> We aimed to answer key business questions such as:
>
> * How many customers were reached by each method?
> * How does revenue vary by method and over time?
> * And ultimately, which approach offers the best balance between performance and operational effort?
>
> The final objective is to provide actionable recommendations to guide the next campaign."

---

### **Slide 2 â€” Analytical Approach**

> "To answer these questions, the analysis was structured into four phases:
>
> * First, we conducted a thorough **data validation and cleaning** step to ensure reliability.
> * Then, we performed **exploratory analysis** to identify key patterns across customers, revenue, and methods.
> * Next, we defined **two business metrics** to evaluate method efficiency.
> * And finally, we combined all insights to formulate strategic **recommendations** for future campaigns."

### **Slide 3 â€” Key Finding: Customer Reach vs Total Revenue**

> "Letâ€™s begin with the first key observation.
>
> When we look at the number of customers reached and the total revenue per method, we see that:
>
> * **Email** had the widest reach and generated the **highest total revenue**.
> * The **Call** method reached fewer customers than Email, but more than Email+Call â€” yet it generated the **lowest revenue** overall.
> * Surprisingly, the **Email+Call** method, despite reaching the smallest audience, **outperformed Call** in revenue and ranked second.
>
> This raises a first important question:
> *How can a method with the smallest reach outperform another in total revenue?*
> Weâ€™ll try to understand this shift better as we move forward."

---

### **Slide 4 â€” Key Finding: Temporal Shift**

> "Continuing the analysis, we also examined how performance evolved over time.
>
> We can observe that **Week 1** had the largest customer acquisition. Then, activity stabilized from **Week 2 to Week 5**, before declining in **Week 6**.
>
> However, the revenue trend does not follow the same pattern.
> Even with fewer customers after Week 1, **revenue remained strong in Weeks 4 and 5** â€” suggesting that customers acquired during that period were generating **more value**.
>
> This deepens our initial question:
> *What changed during those weeks that led to better results despite fewer new clients?*"

---

### **Slide 5 â€” Key Finding: Method Performance Over Time**

> "Looking again at performance over time â€” but this time **broken down by method** â€” we begin to get some answers.
>
> The rise in total revenue in the latter weeks coincides with a **surge in performance from the Email+Call method**.
> Even though it started behind, Email+Call gained momentum and **overtook the other methods by Week 5**.
>
> So while Email brought the most customers, itâ€™s **Email+Call** that **generated the most revenue in the final stages**.
>
> This brings us back to our original question:
> *How can a method with fewer customers end up being more profitable?*"

---

### **Slide 6 â€” Key Finding: Average Revenue per Customer**

> "We now look at **average revenue per client**.
>
> The Email+Call method clearly **generates the highest revenue per customer**, well above the others.
>
> Email, despite its broad reach, delivers a **lower average revenue** per client â€” while Call remains low on both fronts.
>
> Weekly trends confirm that Email+Call revenue per customer **steadily increased** as the campaign progressed.
>
> This insight answers our key question:
> *Why did total revenue rise even with fewer customers?* â†’ Simply because those customers were **more valuable**."

---

### **Slide 7 â€” Other Variables & Geographic Insight**

> "We also explored other variables â€” such as customer tenure, products sold, and site visits â€” to explain revenue differences.
> But no significant patterns were found.
>
> However, when we looked at **geographic segmentation**, clear profiles emerged:
>
> * States like **California**, **Texas**, and **New York** have **many customers** but lower average revenue per client. These are volume-driven markets.
>
> * In contrast, states like **Vermont**, **Delaware**, and **South Dakota** have fewer customers but a **much higher average spend per client**.
>
> These smaller markets may be better suited for **more personalized methods** like Email+Call."

---

### **Slide 8 â€” Business Metrics**

> "To support decision-making, we defined two key business metrics:
>
> 1. **Revenue per Hour** â€” to measure how much return each method generates based on estimated effort.
>
> 2. **Average Revenue per Customer** â€” to evaluate value generation regardless of effort.
>
> These metrics help balance performance **with cost and team workload**, giving us a clearer picture of each methodâ€™s efficiency."

---

### **Slide 9 â€” Summary & Recommendations**

> "In summary:
>
> * **Email** is the best for broad reach and remains efficient in high-density states.
> * **Call** is the least effective â€” itâ€™s costly and underperforms, and should be discontinued.
> * **Email+Call** delivers the highest value per client and performs well in smaller or niche markets where customer value is high.
>
> Therefore, we recommend:
>
> * Using **Email** as the **primary method** in large states.
> * **Discontinuing Call-only** campaigns.
> * **Intensifying Email+Call** efforts in regions where **personalized engagement** delivers stronger returns.
>
> Ultimately, the best method depends on whether your priority is **volume** or **value**."
